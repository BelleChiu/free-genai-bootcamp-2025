## Formatting Instructions

The formatted output will generally contain three parts:

- clues and considerations


### Vocabulary Table
- the table should only include nouns, verbs, adverbs, adjectives
- the table of vocabulary should only have the following columns: Japanese, Romaji, English, Tranditional Chinese
- Do not provide particles in vocabulary table, student needs to figure the correct particles to use
- ensure there are no repeats. eg. if miru verb is repeat twice, show it only once.
- if there is more than one version of a word, show the most common example


### Sentence Structure
- do not provide particles in the sentence structure
- do not provide tenses or conjugations in the sentence
- remember to consider beginner level sentence structures

Here is an example of simple sentence structures

- I study Japanese. → [Subject] + [Object] + [Verb]
- He eats breakfast. → [Subject] + [Object] + [Verb]
- What is this? → [Subject] + [Question Word] + [Verb]
- What time do you go to sleep? → [Subject] + [Time] + [Verb]
- I wake up at 7 a.m. → [Time] + [Verb]
